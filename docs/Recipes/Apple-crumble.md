>Serves: 8 | Time: 1h
### Ingredients 

- **Filling Ingredients:**
	- 8 apples, peeled, cored, and diced
	- 1/3 cup brown sugar
	- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
	- 2 tsp cinnamon powder
	- 1/4 tsp nutmeg powder
- **Topping Ingredients:**
	- 1 cup old-fashioned rolled oat
	- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
	- 1/3 cup brown sugar
	- 1/2 cup of cut up nuts
	- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces
	- 1 tsp cinnamon powder
	- 1/4 tsp nutmeg powder
	- A pinch of salt
### Steps
1. **Preparation**: Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Lightly grease a 9x9-inch baking dish with either non-stick spray or softened butter and keep it ready.
2. **Prepare the Filling:** In a large bowl, mix together the diced apples, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg until the apples are uniformly coated. Pour this apple blend into your previously prepared baking dish, spreading it out evenly.
3. **Topping Preparation**: In another bowl, merge the rolled oats, flour, brown sugar, butter chunks, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a dash of salt. Blend using a fork or pastry cutter until you get a crumbly texture with butter evenly incorporated.
4. **Assemble**: Evenly spread the crumbly topping over the apple layer in the baking dish. To smooth it out, gently pat it down with a spatula or the rear side of a spoon
5. **Baking**: Transfer the dish to the oven. Bake for around 40-45 minutes, or until you notice the topping turning a golden shade and the apple layer bubbling at the sides
6. **Cool and Serve**: After baking, set the apple crisp aside to cool for a bit. It's best served warm, either solo or with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. Dive in and relish your homemade apple delight!
