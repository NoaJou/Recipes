> Serves … | Time 10min
### Ingredients:
- 2 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1/2 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (then add more if you like after tasting it)
- 1 tablespoon honey or brown sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
- A pinch of cayenne pepper
### Instructions:
1. In a small saucepan, combine the tomato paste and water, stirring until well combined.
2. Add in the apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, allspice, and cayenne pepper.
3. Stir the ingredients together until well combined.
4. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 5-7 minutes. You can skip this step if you are using honey instead of brown sugar.
5. Stir the mixture occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
6. Remove the pan from the heat and let the ketchup cool for a few minutes.
7. Once the ketchup has cooled slightly, transfer it to a small jar or container with a lid and store it in the fridge. It will keep for up to 2 weeks.
