> Serves 3 | Time: 30-40min

> Seasoned tofu and chickpeas in an aromatic tomato based gravy
### Ingredients
#### The Tofu
- ⁠1 tbsp vegan butter (or regular butter)
- 350g extra firm tofu
- ¼ tsp salt
- ⅛ tsp turmeric
- Black pepper
- ½ tsp garam masala
#### The Gravy
- ⁠1 tbsp vegan butter (or regular butter)
- ¼ tsp ground cinnamon
- tsp ground cloves
- ¼ tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp fresh ginger, grated
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups passata or canned crushed tomatoes
- 1 cup chickpeas
- 2 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp ground fenugreek seeds (optional in my opinion)
- ⅛ tsp hot red chilli powder
- ½ tsp cane sugar
- ¼ tsp salt
- ½ cup dairy-free unsweetened yogurt (or regular yogurt)
- filtered water (only add if yoghurt or sauce is too thick)
### Steps
1. ⁠Add 1 tablespoon vegan butter to a large saute pan over medium heat and drain any excess liquid from the tofu. Pull the tofu into chunks using your hands (I find this helps to create a look closer to chicken because the edges are rough and the pieces are different sizes). Cook the seasoned tofu for 10 minutes or until the pieces are nicely browned.
2. ⁠Meanwhile, have all your spices and other ingredients at the ready so you can add them quickly to make the sauce.
3. ⁠When the tofu is nicely browned, add the additional 1 tablespoon vegan butter to the pan.
4. ⁠Add the cinnamon, cloves, turmeric, and grated ginger. Toast those spices for 1 – 2 minutes until fragrant (stirring frequently).
5. ⁠Add the minced garlic and saute for another minute until fragrant.
6. ⁠Add the passata or crushed tomatoes, chickpeas, the garam masala, fenugreek seeds, hot chilli powder, cane sugar, and salt. Cook for an additional 5 – 10 min until the tomatoes have thickened and started to reduce.
7. ⁠Stir in the water and yogurt. Reduce the heat to low if the gravy is bubbling too much and cook for another few minutes until the gravy is warmed through.
8. ⁠Serve alongside brown basmati rice (I like to toss mine with a bit of cilantro and lime juice if I have it).
