> Makes 6 breads
### Ingredients
- 1 tsp (1 tsp) dried yeast
- 1 tsp (1 tsp) sugar
- 2 ½ cups (300 g) flour
- ⅞ cup (200 ml) warm water
- 2 tbsp (30 ml) olive oil
- 1 tsp salt
### Steps
1. In a large bowl, mix all the ingredients into a moist dough. No need to knead!
2. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size - about 1 hour. 
3. With floured hands, briefly 'knock back' the dough by making it into a ball.
4. Tip the dough out onto a floured surface and divide into even pieces.
