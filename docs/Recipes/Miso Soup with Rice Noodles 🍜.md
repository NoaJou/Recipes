>Serves: 2 | Time: 20min
### Ingredients 
- Rice noodles (Pad Thai style i.e. on the thicker side). Quantity depends on your appetite.
- Wakame
- 3-4 Tbsp of Miso
- (optional) Gochujang pepper paste
- 1 Courgette or a couple of florets of Broccoli (or other vegetables likes bok choi)
- A few mushrooms
- [[Japanese Egg Roll ðŸ¥¢]] (or just a boiled egg, cut into quarters)

*You can easily add other ingredients like tofu or carrots to the mix.*
### Steps
1. Prepare the [[Japanese Egg Roll ðŸ¥¢]] or boil 2 eggs.
2. Slice the courgette into pieces about 5cm long and 0.5cm thick.
3. Cut up the mushrooms. About 1 to 1.5 cm thick, as you want to be able to grab them well with the chopsticks while eating. 
4. Fry up the courgette pieces (or small broccoli florets) in a large pan until done. Then fry up the mushrooms. Set aside.
5. While the courgette is cooking, boil some water. Place the rice noodles and wakame in a big bowl and pour in the boiled water to cover both. Once the rice noodles are done, drain the water out and rinse the noodles with cold water.
6. Mix the miso (and gochujang paste if desired) with some cool water in a small bowl.
7. Boil some more water.
8. Assemble the serving bowls. First add the rice noodles and wakame. On top of the noodles place the courgette/broccoli, mushrooms, and egg roll/eggs. Then pour in some of the boiled water, which should have cooled down a bit at this point. Pour in the miso mixture at the very end.
9. Serve. Arguably its easiest to eat with chopsticks.
