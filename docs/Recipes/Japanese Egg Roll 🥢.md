This dish is known as **Tamagoyaki** in Japanese. Very tasty in [[Miso Soup with Rice Noodles üçú]] or with sushi.
### Ingredients 
- 3 eggs
- Dash of soy sauce
- Sunflower oil or butter
### Steps
1. Mix together the 3 eggs and a dash of soy sauce (probably less than a tablespoon).
2. Heat up a good non-stick pan (√∏ 24 cm) with the oil. Medium heat.
3. Add a thin layer of the mixed eggs (not the whole mixture). When it looks nearly done, but still a bit runny on top, start rolling/folding the egg up in small increments. Leave about 5 cm of the egg unrolled.
4. Slide the egg back, with the unrolled side at the top. Pour another thin layer of the mixed eggs, and once almost done start rolling it, again leaving about 5 cm of the egg unrolled.
5. Continue until there is no egg mixture left (usually it takes 3 iterations of spreading out the thin layer of egg). Then roll it up completely.
6. Cut into slithers of your desired thickness.
