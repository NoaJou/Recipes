### Ingredients:
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 8 oz. mushrooms, sliced
- 1 onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 zucchini, diced
- 2 carrots, peeled and diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tbsp. butter
- 2 tbsp. olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### Instructions:
1. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the diced red bell pepper, sliced mushrooms, diced carrots, and diced celery to the skillet and sauté for another 5-7 minutes, until vegetables are softened.
3. Add the minced garlic to the skillet and sauté for another 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.
4. Add the Arborio rice to the skillet and stir to coat with the vegetables and oil. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.
5. Pour in the white wine and stir until absorbed.
6. Add the vegetable broth, one ladleful at a time, stirring constantly until the broth is absorbed before adding the next ladleful. Continue this process until the rice is almost cooked, about 15-20 minutes.
7. Add the diced zucchini to the skillet and cook for another 5-7 minutes, until the zucchini is tender but still slightly firm.
8. Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese and butter, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
