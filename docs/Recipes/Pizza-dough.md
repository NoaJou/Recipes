# Pizza Dough 🍕

>Serves: 6 | Time: 30min prep / 15h wait
### Ingredients
- 1kg flour - Type 550 -> Protein content should be around 13g/100g
- 600ml lukewarm water
- about 1/2 to 1 packet of dry yeast (about 4g) (more for older yeast)
- 15g salt
- 1/2 tsp sugar
- some olive oil for your hands
- some semolina or grits
### Steps
Note: The preparation is divided into 3 phases, each interrupted by resting periods.
#### Phase 1: Making the Dough
1. Mix 500ml of lukewarm water with yeast and sugar and let it sit until foam forms on the water or the water slightly bubbles, indicating that the yeast has become active. Reserve the remaining 100ml of water.
2. Place the flour in a large bowl.
3. Pour the yeast-water mixture into the flour and start kneading with a large spoon. Alternatively, use dough hooks or a kitchen machine for kneading.
4. Once it's slightly kneaded, add the salt and continue kneading.
5. If dough hooks or similar tools are no longer sufficient, rub your hands with some oil and knead the dough by hand on a smooth surface.
6. Depending on the flour, add the remaining 100ml of water until the dough becomes smooth.
7. Knead the dough by hand for about 5 minutes continuously and shape it into a large ball. See kneading technique: [link](https://youtu.be/g_B8fP-3yKE?t=98)
8. Sprinkle some semolina or grits in a large container and place the kneaded dough on top. Make sure the dough has enough space to expand.
9. If you don't have a container with a lid, you can use a baking dish covered with plastic wrap to seal it airtight.
10. Let the dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 15 hours. Longer is also fine (up to 1 week).
#### Phase 2: Preparing Dough Balls
1. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and divide it into 6 equal pieces. A scale can be helpful; each dough piece should be around 200-250g.
2. Knead each of the dough pieces briefly and shape them into nice balls. See kneading technique: [link](https://youtu.be/g_B8fP-3yKE?t=145)
3. Sprinkle semolina or grits in large containers for the dough balls.
4. Place the individual dough balls in the containers, leaving enough space between them (at least 1/2 dough ball apart).
5. Let them rest at a warm temperature with the lid closed for 2-4 hours. Optimal temperature is 25-35°C, never exceed 47°C!
6. If you don't have enough containers, you can brush the dough balls with oil and cover them with a kitchen towel on a baking sheet (the dough must not dry out).
#### Phase 3: Making Pizza
1. Prepare pizza ingredients.
2. Preheat the oven to the maximum temperature (ideally 400°C, 250°C or 230°C will work too).
3. Sprinkle semolina or grits on a smooth work surface.
4. Take the dough ball of your choice from the container and place it on the semolina or grits.
5. Start shaping the pizza with your hand from the center by pulling and pressing. Never crush the edges! See: [link](https://youtu.be/g_B8fP-3yKE?t=198)
6. Add sauce, toppings, and cheese, then immediately put it in the oven (don't let it stand with sauce for too long, or the dough will become too moist).
