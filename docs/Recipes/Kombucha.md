![Kombucha|500](https://i.imgur.com/RCtMloL.jpg|20)

>  Yields: ca. 3L | Prep Time: 30min | Total Time: 10 day or so
### Ingredients
- Scoby
- 5L glass container
- 8 bags of black or green tea
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 cups of kombucha starter
- 3 litres of water
### Steps
1. Boil 1 liter of water
2. Add 8 bags of tea and the boiled water to the glass container
3. Add the sugar and mix
4. Wait for 5min or until the tea is done
5. Remove the tea bags and add 2 litres of water (not boiled)
6. Once the liquid is at room temperature, add the 2 cups of started liquid and the scoby.
7. Cover the container with a cloth and rubber band (or similar) to ensure that no dust enters while the scoby ‘breathes’
8. Wait 10 or so days. Test if the kombucha is to your liking. If it is too sweet, leave it for a couple more days. If it is ready, bottle it up and prepare the next batch.

Note: Best to use plastic or wood when handling the Scoby. Avoid using metal.
